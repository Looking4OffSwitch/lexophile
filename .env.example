# Word List API Server Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed

# Port the server will listen on (default: 8080)
PORT=8080

# Path to the word list JSON file (relative to app.py)
WORD_LIST=word_list.json

# Optional: Return a specific word instead of random
# Uncomment and set to a word key from your word_list.json to always return that word
# Useful for testing or debugging
# FIXED_WORD_KEY=example_word_key

# Gunicorn workers (production only)
# For this lightweight API, 1 worker is usually sufficient (handles ~100s req/sec)
# Only increase if you experience high traffic or slow responses
# Formula for high traffic: (2 * CPU_CORES) + 1
# Default: 1
# WORKERS=1
